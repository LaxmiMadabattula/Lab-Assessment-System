# Lab-Assessment-System

In the current existing system, course instructors orally take viva voce and manually allot marks to every individual. Effort that instructor should put increases as the no. of students increases in the system. Manual tracking may lead to data loss, improper and inconsistent data storage. If this system is automated, efficiency increases as the  no. of students in the system increases. 	The proposed system is as  follows. Faculty logs in with admin credentials and upload questions. Once faculty uploads questions, they get enabled to students. Students answer the question within given time limit. Once they submit, their result gets displayed on screen and corresponding ranks are generated. Students can answer viva questions based on their time pace but within that day. Because, faculty can remove the Viva questions after that day. Along with these functionalities, faculty can further view all the users and perform week wise calculation. In Week wise calculation, once faculty enters the name of subject, all the corresponding viva exams are aggregated. This gives the overall performance of each student in all weeks. In this way, we can automate the existing viva assessment model.
